# Python-Programs
Some Programs I write, mostly as fun mini exercises


1. birthday_days.py - this program was written in 2.7, by inputting your birthday, it will return the number of days you have been alive! Useless program, but a good, fun programming excercise lol

2. maths.py - written in 2.7, this program finds the set of pythagorean triples.

3. More Maths.py - this python code was written in 3.0, and contains some more miscallaneous maths formula as some simple for loop programs to get myself familiar with Python.
