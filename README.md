# Python-Programs
Afternoon, let's dive into the world of Python programming. Here are some Programs I wrote, mostly as fun mini exercises but mostly to understand the basics of Python. In conjunction to the Introduction to Python Programming course at Udacity, I have also taken some time to write programs relating to mathematics.


1. birthday_days.py - this program was written in 2.7, by inputting your birthday, it will return the number of days you have been alive! Useless(?) program, but a good, fun programming excercise for those who wish to start to learn Python.

2. maths.py - written in 2.7, this program finds the set of pythagorean triples.

3. More Maths.py - this python code was written in 3.0, and contains some more miscallaneous maths formula as some simple for loop programs to get myself familiar with Python.
